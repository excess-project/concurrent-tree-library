RELEASE NOTES
-------------

   * Synchrobench has been used to compare STM performance to lock-based 
     and lock-free alternatives in "Elastic Transactions", EPFL Tech. Rep. 
     LPD-REPORT-2009-002, also published at DISC'09, and "A Speculation
     Friendly Binary Search Tree" published at PPoPP 2012. 
     Contact Vincent Gramoli <vincent.gramoli@epfl.ch> for any 
     question.

   * Transactional Primitives - API:
     TX_START(NL)  -- Marks the beginning of a regular transaction
     TX_START(EL)  -- Marks the beginning of an elastic transaction
     END           -- Marks the attempt to commit the current transaction
     TX_LOAD(x)    -- Calls the transactional load a memory location x
     TX_STORE(x,v) -- Calls the transactional store of v at x
