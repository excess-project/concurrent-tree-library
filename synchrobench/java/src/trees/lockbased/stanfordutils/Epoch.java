// Epoch

package trees.lockbased.stanfordutils;

/** A <code>Epoch</code> has a lifecycle consisting of three phases: active,
 *  closing, and closed.  During the active phase partipants may arrive and
 *  leave the epoch.  Once a close has been requested, new participants are not
 *  allowed, only leaving is possible.  Once close has been requested and all
 *  participants have left, the epoch is transitioned to the closed state.
 *  <p>
 *  Entry is performed with {@link #attemptArrive}, which returns a non-null
 *  ticket on success or null if {@link #beginClose} has already been called.
 *  Each successful call to <code>attemptArrive</code> must be paired by a call
 *  to {@link Ticket#leave} on the returned ticket.
 *  <p>
 *  The abstract method {@link #onClosed} will be invoked exactly once after
 *  the epoch becomes closed.  It will be passed the sum of the values passed
 *  to {@link Ticket#leave}.  There is no way to query the current participant
 *  count or state of the epoch without changing it.
 *  <p>
 *  Internally the epoch responds to contention by increasing its size,
 *  striping the participant count across multiple objects (and hopefully
 *  multiple cache lines).  Once close has begun, the epoch converts itself to
 *  a single-shot hierarchical barrier, that also performs a hierarchical
 *  reduction of the leave parameters.
