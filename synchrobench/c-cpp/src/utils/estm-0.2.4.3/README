INSTALL
-------
Set path to your local atomic_ops library in [estm]/Makefile
And execute the makefile:

> make

REQUIRED
--------
1. Library atomic_ops http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/
2. On SPARC, add the patch for compare-and-swap to the library directory.

OVERVIEW
--------
e-STM is the first software transactional memory supporting elastic 
transactions. Elastic transactions are a variant of the 
transactional model. Upon conflict detection, an elastic 
transaction might drop what it did so far within a separate 
transaction that immediately commits, and initiate a new 
transaction which might itself be elastic.

Elastic transactions are a complementary alternative to traditional 
transactions, particularly appealing when implementing search 
structures. Both forms of transactions can safely be combined 
within the same application. e-STM builds upon tinySTM 
(http://tmware.org/tinystm) and replacing normal transaction
by elastic ones increase performance by 36% (on average). Our 
measurements are taken from the micro-benchmarks that come 
with the current distribution.

TEST
----
Compile benchmarks:

> make bench

Example of benchmarks:
If you want to execute insert/delete/search (90%/5%/5%) operations on a skip list
implementation of an integer set with an average size of 1024 (-i1024) elements, 
using 32 threads and using elastic transactions for all operations (-x4)

> ./bench/lf-skiplist -x4 -u10 -i1024 -n32

32 threads execute 10% updates on 1024 elements.  

e-STM has been tested on an 
- 1.6GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Mac OS X.
