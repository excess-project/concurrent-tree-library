REQUIREMENTS
------------

   * STMs. Microbench aimed at testing an STM. Some are available online:
     - TinySTM   http://tmware.org/tinystm
     - SwissTM   http://lpd.epfl.ch/site/research/tmeval
     - E-STM     http://lpd.epfl.ch/gramoli/php/estm


INSTALL
-------  

   1. Download an STM (e.g., http://lpd.epfl.ch/gramoli/php/estm) 
      Compile the STM
 
   2. Set ./common/Makefile.common
      - libatomic_ops directory (LIBAO)
      - STM directories (e.g., ESTMDIR)

   3. Compile with E-STM using 
        make estm

   NB Alternatively, you can directly use the lock-based versions 
      (without using any STM) by compiling the mutex or spinlock 
      versions as follows:
        make lock 
        make spinlock


RUN
---

   1. Executables for double-ended queue, hash table, linked list, 
      red-black tree, skip list, speculation-friendly binary search tree, 
      lock-based linked list, lock-based hashtable, lock-based skip list
      are located in 'bin':
      ./bin/lf-dq
      ./bin/lf-ht
      ./bin/lf-ll
      ./bin/lf-rt 
      ./bin/lf-sl
      ./bin/lf-st
      ./bin/lb-ht
      ./bin/lb-ll
      ./bin/lb-sl
   2. Use parameter "--help" for the full list of parameters
